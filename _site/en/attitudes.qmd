# Ability to Recognize and Influence AI {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills .break}

> With artificial intelligence (AI), computer programs can perform tasks themselves and also learn themselves. AI is increasingly used in society, and also in online media. Many websites use AI to show you more content and ads you like. The following questions are about the offers (such as articles, films or songs) that are shown to you on websites and apps for news and entertainment (e.g. Netflix or Spotify).
