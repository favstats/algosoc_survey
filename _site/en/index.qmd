> Welcome to the AlgoSoc *AI Opinion Monitor*, providing insights into public perceptions and experiences with artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision making (ADM) systems in society! We asked *3,946 respondents* in the Netherlands what they think about this topic. 


This dashboard aggregates data collected via the <a href="https://algosoc.org/" target="_blank">AlgoSoc Consortium</a> to show how citizens think and feel about AI in society. The dashboard is divided into three main pages.

### Methodology

This first wave of data collection interviewed a total of *3,946 participants* on key questions surrounding algorithms and public values across the sectors of health, justice and media. The data was collected as part of [Centerdataâ€™s](https://www.centerdata.nl/) [LISS panel](https://www.lissdata.nl/) throughout March of 2024.

### More on AlgoSoc

In the emerging algorithmic society, key decisions are no longer made by humans alone. Datafication, sophisticated algorithms, and increasingly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models mean that Automated Decision-Making Systems (ADM) now complement and in part replace human decision-making. While outsourcing decision-making to (quasi-)automated systems may yield better decisions and faster and more efficient services, it also transforms established routines, checks and balances, and decision-making institutions, leading to new challenges for realizing public values and unprecedented shifts in decision-making power.


The NWO Gravitation Program *Public Values in the Algorithmic Society*   (AlgoSoc) is a response to the urgent need for an informed societal perspective on automation and automated decision-making. Grounded in a deep understanding of the systemic changes that ADS entail, AlgoSoc examines how to realize public values across the sectors of *justice*, *health*, and *media*. It leverages interdisciplinary expertise combining the social sciences, humanities, law, and computer science to develop governance frameworks that complement technology-driven ADM initiatives in society.
