> Welcome to the AlgoSoc AI Monitor, providing insights into public perceptions and experiences with artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision making (ADM) systems in society! We asked *3,946 respondents* in the Netherlands what they think about this topic. 


This dashboard aggregates data collected via the <a href="https://algosoc.org/" target="_blank">AlgoSoc Consortium</a> to show how citizens think and feel about AI in society. The dashboard is divided into three main pages.
